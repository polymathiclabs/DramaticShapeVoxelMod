-- The sky, generated rather than shipped.
--
-- The overworld's, on every VOXEL rung. Wherever the diorama is drawn the void
-- behind it is sky rather than a black plate: at 75 degrees the horizon is
-- genuinely in frame and the bands run down to meet it, and at the steeper rungs
-- the void that shows is the ground running out past the map edge, which gets
-- the same sky above the same haze. A battle's placed camera keeps the flat fill
-- it has always had -- its horizon is above the frame and its look is not this
-- rung's to change.
--
-- THE RECIPE is the 8-bit skybox one: a short palette of blues painted as flat
-- horizontal bands, deepest overhead, with a CHECKERBOARD of the next band
-- dithered into the bottom of each one. Alternating two colours on a pixel grid
-- is how a machine with four colours to a palette got a fifth, sixth and seventh
-- out of them, and it is what keeps four bands reading as a gradient rather than
-- as four stripes. No clouds, nothing moving.
--
-- NOTHING IS RESAMPLED, which is the whole of why it is drawn this way. There is
-- no baked 160x144 picture scaled up to the window and no downsized buffer blown
-- back up: one full-region rectangle through a shader that answers every pixel
-- from its own canvas coordinate. A pixel of sky is computed at the size it is
-- displayed at, so there is nothing for a filter to soften and nothing to go
-- stale when the window or the zoom changes. The shader does bind one texture,
-- but it is a palette rather than an image -- the bands, one texel each, sampled
-- nearest (see rampFor, and why it is not a uniform array).
--
-- THE PIXEL GRID follows the zoom for the same reason. Bands and dither cells
-- are measured in DIORAMA pixels -- the pass's own pixels-per-world-pixel, handed
-- in fresh every frame -- so a chunky sky at 4x is a chunky sky at 12x, band
-- edges land on the same grid the world's own texels do, and a ZOOM keypress is
-- reflected in the frame that follows it rather than whenever something else
-- happened to rebuild.
--
-- PALETTE ORDER, which is easy to get wrong. Stored LIGHTEST FIRST, because that
-- is shade order: a display mode transforms a four-colour palette by replacing it
-- outright (PaletteFX.effectiveColors hands back GRAYS or CLASSIC), and those are
-- written light to dark. So the sky reads the list backwards -- deepest shade
-- overhead, shade 1 at the horizon -- and GRAY gets greys the right way up for
-- nothing.
--
-- WHAT TIME IT IS decides the colours. The palette itself lives in DayNight
-- (four phase palettes, blended along the clock and re-quantised to the
-- lattice), and this file paints whatever the clock says: blue at noon, gold
-- and violet through the twilights -- warmed further around the low sun by a
-- dithered GLOW -- and deep navy under the moon. The sun and moon themselves
-- hang here too: cell-art discs on the same grid as the dither, scissored to
-- the sky's own region so a setting body slips below the horizon point and is
-- gone, never wandering under the map.

-- ------- the ramp
--

-- which is what they used to be: `uniform vec3 bands[8]`, filled from Lua and
-- read through a loop counter. On desktop GL that is as portable as it looks.
-- On Android it was not. The sky's lower bands came back BLACK -- a hard-edged
-- strip running from partway down the gradient to the horizon point, with the
-- moon still drawn correctly over it, and with the haze BELOW the sky (the
-- palest band again, but delivered by love.graphics.clear instead of by the
-- array) landing in exactly the right colour. Same colour, two routes, one of
-- them black: the fault was the array, not the palette.
--
-- Which of the ES failure modes it was hardly matters -- a driver that
-- truncates a partially-filled array, a fragment uniform budget the guaranteed
-- floor of which is sixteen vectors (eight bands plus the glow plus LOVE's own
-- built-ins is over it), a reflection that finds bands[0] and nothing after --
-- because they all have the same shape: slots past the first few read as zero,
-- and zero is black.
--
-- A sampler has none of them. One texture unit replaces eight uniform vectors,
-- there is no array to index and no budget to overrun, and a texel that does
-- not exist cannot read as black because the image is built at exactly the
-- width the shader divides by. Nearest and clamped, so a sample lands on one
-- band's own colour and an out-of-range one lands on the end band rather than
-- on nothing.
